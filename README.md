  <p align="center">
    I developed a program to predict my newsletter subscribers using Machine Learning and Linear Regression.


## Juan David's Newsletter

I write a Weekly Memo that I send to hundreds of leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators about Curiosities, latest trends, and coolest hacks.

This is also the place where I share interesting ideas, personal updates, and the new projects Iâ€™m doing/learning more about.

Join hundreds of curious and fascinating people [HERE](https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter).
